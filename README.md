##about me
Hi, my name is HalF.

I'm part of a team of devs named BYTE, but this is a solo project made by me only.

## How it works: 
using a bookmarklet to run JavaScript code client-side, it optimizes performance and adds tons of mods to make ChatGPT run better.

## Copy this into a bookmark on your browser

```
javascript:(function(){var script=document.createElement('script');script.src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HalF-siDe/BYTEgpt/main/BYTEgpt.md';document.body.appendChild(script);})();
